Object trait is located in `Eightshift Libs`. To extend it, use `Eightshift_Libs\Helpers\Object_Helper` namespace.

All of us have some custom helpers and stuff that we use around on multiple the project. We have created this simple trait helper that you can use in any PHP class as a [trait](/eightshift-docs/docs/guides/extending-classes). To see all the class helper go [here](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-libs/blob/develop/src/helpers/class-object-helper.php) and help your selves.
