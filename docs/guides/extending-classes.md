We are providing abstract classes, interfaces, helpers, Dependency Injection and namespaces for your project. In general you can use anything as is from the vendors library as or you can modify/add functionality to the existing clases by extending it in your project.

If you are farmiliar with the extending classes in php language then you can just skip this chapter but for the rest of you here is and awesome description on how advance stuff in PHP works:
