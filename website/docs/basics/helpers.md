Each project has helpers classes that helps you with your project code and you generally reuse them all over the place. We tried to combine all our helpers in one place for convenience. The main difference is that we have helpers for different languages:

- [JavaScript Helpers](helpers-javascript)
- [Scss Helpers](helpers-scss)
- [Php Helpers](helpers-php)
