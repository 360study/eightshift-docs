Before WordPress landed in the 5.0 release, the themes were mostly PHP based on some JavaScript and CSS. Now it's a bit different because now we have PHP in the core, JavaScript (specifically React.js) in the Block Editor, and some styles in the editor and the theme parts of the website.

Now that everything is different, we must adapt to the change and as well.

As you already saw in the previous chapters about [Eightshift Libs](eightshift-libs.md) and [Eightshift Frontend Libs](eightshift-frontend-libs.md), we have two different technologies in out boilerplate, so we must separate the documentation the same way.

## Let's finally start with documentation

We took our time to set up a bunch of WP-CLI commands. That should help you set up everything and use all our features, without worrying about correct names, files, and organization. You can find out more about it on this link:

[WP-CLI](wp-cli)

If you want to know how to use service classes, or how dependency injection container works with auto wiring, or maybe you would like to read about our extensive WP-CLI features, this link is for you:

[Backend stuff](backend)

If you would instead check what we have prepared regarding the JavaScript Babel, Webpack, or how we ensure that all our code is the same across multiple developers, then this link is for you:

[Frontend stuff](frontend)

On the other hand, if you would like to see our extensive **Dynamic Blocks** collection and how you can use them with all the developer's flexibility and as little code duplication as possible, check this link:

[Block Editor Blocks](blocks)
