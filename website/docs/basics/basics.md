Before WordPress landed in 5.0 release it way mostly PHP based project with some JavaScript and CSS in the themes. Not it it a bit different, we now have PHP in the core, JavaScript (specifically Reach) in the Block Editor and some styles in the editor part and the theme part.

Now that everything is different we must adopt to the change and as well.

As you all-ready read in the previous chapters about [Eightshift Libs](eightshift-libs.md) and [Eightshift Frontend Libs](eightshift-frontend-libs.md) we have two totally different technologies in out boilerplate so we must separate the documentation the same way.

## Lets finally start with documentation

We took our time to setup 40+ WP-CLI commands that will help you setup everything and use all our features without worrying about correct names, files and organisation. You can find out more on this link:

[WP-CLI](wp-cli)

If you want to know how to use service classes, or how Dependency injection container works with autowiring, or maybe you would like to read about our extensive WP-CLI features, this link is for you:

[Backend stuff](backend)

Or you would rather check what we have prepared regarding the JavaScript Babel, Webpack, or how we ensure tha all our code is the same across multiple developers, then this link is for you:

[Frontend stuff](frontend)

On the other hand if you would like to see or extensive **Dynamic Blocks** collection and how you can use them with all the developers flexibility and as little code duplication as possible, go check this link:

[Block Editor Blocks](blocks)
