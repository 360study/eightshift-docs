In order for to have the smoothest development and setup experience we need some things to be installed on your computer.
Please install this packages before you start the setup.

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
3. [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/)
4. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Make sure that you have all this packages installed and ready to use on your system. To make sure that they work, run this commands:
- `node -v`
- `composer -v`
- `wp --info`
- `git --version`


If it doesn't return any errors you are good to go.

# Now you must decide!

We are prepared for all your development needs, so decide what are you going to develop next:
* [New Theme](create-new-theme.md)
* [New Plugin](create-new-plugin.md)
